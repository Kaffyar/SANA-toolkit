# Authentication System Changes Summary

## Issue: Duplicate OTPs Being Sent During Login

### Changes Made

1. **Fixed Database Schema**
   - Modified `user_otp` table to use `TEXT` type for `user_id` instead of `INTEGER`
   - Removed foreign key constraint to allow temporary IDs for signup OTPs
   - Ensured `temp_registrations` table has `created_at` field for rate limiting

2. **Enhanced OTP Service (`models/email_otp_service.py`)**
   - Added rate limiting for OTP generation (30 seconds)
   - Improved logging with proper logger instead of print statements
   - Added check for recent unused OTPs before creating new ones
   - Added better error handling and cleanup of expired OTPs

3. **Updated User Manager (`models/user_model.py`)**
   - Enhanced `send_login_otp` to check for recent OTPs before sending new ones
   - Improved `send_signup_otp` to handle temporary registrations properly
   - Added proper return values for signup OTP function (including temp_id)
   - Added case-insensitive email handling (lowercase all emails)

4. **Fixed Authentication Routes (`routes/auth_routes.py`)**
   - Added session-based rate limiting for OTP requests
   - Improved handling of password in signup OTP request
   - Fixed resend OTP functionality to respect rate limits
   - Added better error handling and feedback

5. **Enhanced Frontend (`static/js/auth.js`)**
   - Fixed notification system to prevent duplicate notifications
   - Updated signup form to include password in the initial request
   - Added debounce for form submissions to prevent duplicate requests

6. **Updated Signup Form (`templates/auth/signup.html`)**
   - Added proper password validation and requirements checking
   - Fixed form submission to include password
   - Added interactive password requirements UI updates

### Testing

Created a test script (`test_auth.py`) that verifies:
- OTP duplicate prevention for login
- OTP duplicate prevention for signup
- Rate limiting for both flows

### Results

- The system now properly prevents duplicate OTPs from being sent within a 30-second window
- Both backend and frontend have rate limiting mechanisms
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Better database schema to support temporary registrations
- Interactive password requirements UI works correctly
- Notifications no longer show duplicates

### Next Steps

1. Monitor the system in production to ensure the changes work as expected
2. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for the authentication flow
3. Implement additional security measures like IP-based rate limiting if needed
